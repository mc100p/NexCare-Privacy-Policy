1. Purpose of This Policy
   This policy outlines:
   How users can request deletion of their data,
   What information may be deleted,
   What data we may retain for legal or operational reasons, and
   How we ensure secure deletion of data.
2. Scope
   This policy applies to all users of the NexCare mobile application, including:
   Patients,
   Healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, assistants), and
   Administrative users.
   It covers all forms of data collected through our app and related services, such as:
   Personal and contact details
   Health and medical information
   Appointment and billing records
   AI-generated reports and interactions
   Account and login information
3. How to Request Data Deletion
   If you wish to delete your account or any associated data, you can submit a Data Deletion Request by contacting us through one of the following methods:
   üìß Email: [Insert Support Email Address]
   üì± In-App: Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Delete My Data (if available)
   Your request should include:
   Your full name
   Registered email address or phone number
   A short statement confirming your intent to delete your account and data
   Once we receive your request, we‚Äôll confirm your identity before processing to ensure your data security.

   Uploaded or stored documents and images
   Health-related data (allergies, medications, conditions)
   Appointment history and communication logs
   Payment and billing records (after statutory retention period, if required)

5. Data We May Retain
   In certain cases, we are required by law or medical regulations to retain specific data even after a deletion request. These may include:
   Medical records necessary for ongoing treatment or regulatory compliance
   Financial transactions or invoices required for tax or audit purposes
   Security logs for fraud prevention or legal defense
   In such cases, we retain only the minimum data required and restrict access to authorized personnel only.

   We aim to complete verified deletion requests within 30 days.
   If additional time is required (for example, due to legal review or large data volume), we will notify you promptly and provide an updated timeline.

   Permanent removal from production and backup databases
   Overwriting or anonymizing personal identifiers
   Revocation of access credentials
   Verification of deletion completion by our data protection team
8. Deletion of Linked Accounts
   If your NexCare account was created using a third-party login (e.g., Google or Facebook), you will also need to revoke access from those services separately via their account settings.
9. After Deletion
   Once your data has been deleted:
   You will no longer have access to your NexCare account or services.
   Any digital prescriptions, receipts, or appointment records will no longer be retrievable.
   Notifications, reminders, and messages related to your account will stop immediately.
